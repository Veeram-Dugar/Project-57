    <section id="Books"> My favorite books to read are the Wings of Fire series because I love the excitement, mystery, and adventure in the series. Here is a section about the new book The Dangerous Gift:<br><br>Summary:
        A wall can't protect them anymore …

        Snowfall didn't expect to be queen of the IceWings at such a young age, but now that she is, she's going to be the best queen ever. All she has to do is keep her tribe within IceWing territory, where it's safe — while keeping every other tribe out, where they belong.

        It's a perfect and simple plan, backed up by the Ice Cliff wall and every bit of IceWing magic Snowfall can gather. Perfect, that is, until a storm of unidentified dragons flies in from the ocean, looking for asylum.

        The foreigners are completely strange and, Snowfall is certain, utterly untrustworthy. But as she escorts the miserable new tribes out of her kingdom, the young queen is forced to reconsider her plan. Maybe she can only keep her tribe safe … if she's willing to risk everything.</section>
